# Short-Term-Reversal
Short-term reversal, also known as short-term mean reversion, is a trading or investment strategy that aims to take advantage of the tendency for asset prices to revert to their mean or average levels over a relatively short time frame.

The strategy is based on the belief that after a significant price movement in one direction, the price is likely to reverse or move in the opposite direction in the near term. 

For example, if a stock has experienced a sharp increase in price over a short period, a short-term reversal strategy would involve selling or shorting the stock with the expectation that the price will decline in the near future.
